## Requirements / Notes:

 - [X] The developer has the freedom to beautify the app according to them (can use any UI frameworks such as Bootstrap etc.)

 - [X] Use of Git will be preferable. (If Git is used, host the repo on GitHub or any other hosting services and provide us the link)

 - [X] The data is stored on the user's browser, so there is no need for any server or database.
